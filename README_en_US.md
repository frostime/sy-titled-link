## Get Link Title

1. Right-clicking on a link allows you to access the corresponding webpage and retrieve its title. Replace the anchor text or title of the link with the title of the webpage.
2. Clicking on a block icon, replace all the anchors' text.

> Only take effect for utf-8 website.

By default, the plugin replaces both the anchor text and title attribute of a link. You can customize whether the latter should be replaced in the settings.
